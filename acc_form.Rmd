<!--HOW TO COMPLETE THIS FORM:-->

<!--
1. Checkboxes in this document appear as follows: 

- [ ] This is a checkbox 

To check a checkbox, replace [ ] by [x], as follows: 

- [x] This is a checked checkbox 

Note that older versions of RStudio (versions lower than 1.3) may not create a formatted checkbox but will leave the original characters, i.e., literally "[ ]" or "[x]". It's fine to submit a PDF in this form.
 
2. For text answers, simply type the relevant text in the areas indicated. A blank line starts a new paragraph. 
 
3. Comments (like these instructions) provide additional instructions throughout the form. There is no need to remove them; they will not appear in the compiled document. 

4. If you are comfortable with Markdown syntax, you may choose to include any Markdown-compliant formatting in the form. For example, you may wish to include R code chunks and compile this document in R Markdown.
-->

This form documents the artifacts associated with the article (i.e., the data and code supporting the computational findings) and describes how to reproduce the findings.


# Part 1: Data

- [ ] This paper does not involve analysis of external data (i.e., no data are used or the only data are generated by the authors via simulation in their code).

<!--
If box above is checked and if no simulated/synthetic data files are provided by the authors, please skip directly to the Code section. Otherwise, continue.
-->

- [x] I certify that the author(s) of the manuscript have legitimate access to and permission to use the data used in this manuscript.

<!-- If data are simulated using random number generation, please be sure to set the random number seed in the code you provide -->

## Abstract

<!--
Provide a short (< 100 words), high-level description of the data
-->

The datasets originate from the Voteview project, which tracks every congressional roll call vote in U.S. history. The datasets contain two files: `Sall_members.csv`providing background information on Senators, and `Sall_votes.csv`, recording roll call vote outcomes. While Voteview updates continuously as new votes occur, the version used here represents a snapshot at the time of download and may differ slightly from the most current data available.


## Availability


- [x] Data **are** publicly available.
- [ ] Data **cannot be made** publicly available.

If the data are publicly available, see the *Publicly available data* section. Otherwise, see the *Non-publicly available data* section, below.

### Publicly available data

- [x] Data are available online at: [https://voteview.com/data](https://voteview.com/data)

- [x] Data are available as part of the paper's supplementary material.

- [ ] Data are publicly available by request, following the process described here:

- [ ] Data are or will be made available through some other mechanism, described here:


<!-- If data are available by request to the authors or some other data owner, please make sure to explain the process of requesting access to the data. -->

### Non-publicly available data

<!--
The Journal of the American Statistical Association requires authors to make data accompanying their papers available to the scientific community except in cases where: 1) public sharing of data would be impossible, 2) suitable synthetic data are provided which allow the main analyses to be replicated (recognizing that results may differ from the "real" data analyses), and 3) the scientific value of the results and methods outweigh the lack of reproducibility.

Please discuss the lack of publicly available data. For example:
-	why data sharing is not possible,
-	what synthetic data are provided, and 
-	why the value of the paper's scientific contribution outweighs the lack of reproducibility.

# Part 3: Reproducibility workflow

<!--
The materials provided should provide a straightforward way for reviewers and readers to reproduce analyses with as few steps as possible. 
-->

## Scope

The provided workflow reproduces:

- [ ] Any numbers provided in text in the paper
- [x] The computational method(s) presented in the paper (i.e., code is provided that implements the method(s))
- [x] All tables and figures in the paper
- [ ] Selected tables and figures in the paper, as explained and justified below:

## Workflow

- `simu_degree.R`: conduct experiments for empirical sample complexity analysis on the degree. It is essential for reproducing Figure 1 and Table S1.
- `simu_beta.R`: conduct experiments for empirical sample complexity analysis on the "maximum" signal. It reproduces Figure 2 and Figure S1.
- `simu_high.R`: conduct experiments for high-dimensional cases. It is helpful for reproducing Figure 3 and Figure S2. 
- `simu_p.R`: empirical sample complexity analysis on the dimension. It is essential for reproducing Figure S3.
- `simu_ws.R`: empirical sample complexity analysis on the weakest signal. It reproduces Figure S4.
- `batch.sh`: the shell script for various experiments

### Location

The workflow is available:

<!--
Check all that apply, and in the case of a Git repository include unique identifier, such as specific commit ID, branch, release, or tag.
-->
- [ ] As part of the paper's supplementary material.

<!--
Indicate where the materials (generally including the code, unless in a separate location and indicated in the previous section) are available. We strongly encourage authors to place their materials (but not large datasets) in a Git repository hosted on a site such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If the repository is private during the review process, please indicate the location where it will be available publicly upon publication, and also include the materials as a zip file (e.g., obtained directly from the Git hosting site) as supplementary materials.
